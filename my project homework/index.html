          Apple’s latest iPad Pro might be the laptop replacement you’ve been
          waiting for
        </h2>
        <p>
          Apple has made it abundantly clear throughout the iPad’s decade of
          existence that it’s a touch-first device. It can replace a traditional
          computer in many ways—especially when attached to a keyboard—but
          you’re meant to poke and swipe at the screen without a mouse. With the
          release of the new iPad Pro and iPadOS 13.4, the iPad will fully
          support a mouse and the upcoming keyboard case even includes a
          touchpad much like the one you’d find on a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro.

          If you’re using the iPad almost exclusively as a tablet, this may not
          seem like the biggest deal. After all, wasn’t the point that you’re
          not supposed to have to use a mouse? But, for truly replacing a
          laptop, this is a leap.hola
